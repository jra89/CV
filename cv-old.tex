\subsection*{Work experience}

\textbf{Defensify, Senior Security Consultant (Oct 2019 - Present)} \\
tests into it. \\

\textbf{CoolStuff, Software Engineer (Aug 2018 - Oct 2019)} \\
At CoolStuff I have been working in a small team where we always strive to try new methods of working and doing our tasks to finish our sprints as efficiently as possible. My role in the team was to maintain and build new features for the old part of the system which when I started was most of the applications. Over time this has changed more and more to a newer model and languages. The old parts of the system is old, and with very old code comes often a certain amount of chaos, and I thrive in chaos. I enjoy diving into old broken code and make it better, fix weird bugs that someone wrote ten plus years ago or rewrite parts of the system to welcome new features into it. \\

\textbf{One Agency, Software Engineer (Dec 2017 - Aug 2018)} \\
test. \\

\textbf{Truesec, Security Consultant (Jan 2014 - Jun 2017)} \\
My responsibilities include penetration testing of various systems, code review, report writing and development of tools when the need arises. I also do a lot of security research when there's time for it. I have developed a system in PHP/Laravel that has been included in the packages we offer our customers. This project was developed parallel to another project that I did on my free time (Oddtale). This has been a good experience as code that turned out good and stable in Oddtale was later borrowed and further perfected in the other project at work. \\

\textbf{Avalon Innovation, Software Developer (Jun 2011 - Jan 2014)} \\
I worked with both back end and front end parts of a system, developing functionality in an underlying API that communicates with the different services and databases on the customer network. During my time at Avalon I mostly wrote C\#.Net, but I also used Java in some other minor projects that I had been in (mostly prototype work). I have an extremely high interest for IT-security, and I try to keep my coding and usually the whole process of making the application as security minded as possible. I also try to encourage all my colleagues to think this way as well, so that the quality and security of the end product will be high. During my free time all (or at least most) my projects are IT-security related, and very often involve breaking stuff (I like to break things and then figure out how to un-break them, and prevent them from breaking in the same way again ... yeah, that's probably a good way to describe it). Most other languages that I use frequently (Perl, C/C++ and PHP) is used mostly during my free time for my own projects (I use Java and C\# for private projects as well, although C\# not as often since I don't use Windows at home for development usually). \\
